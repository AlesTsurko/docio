/*metadoc 01_Introduction description
Docio is the documentation generator for Eerie â€” the package manager for Io. 
That means that it generates documentation from comments in sources of an Eerie's package.

After generation process it provides you with an HTML documentation pack that can be used as a site for
your project. It's also generates `docs.txt`, which is used by Docio to print you documentation right
in the console while you interact with the Io's interpreter.

Docio comes with a default template, based on [uikit](http://geuikit.com). But you can provide
your own template. And you can mix HTML with Io in such template.

This site is produced by Docio.

Docio's source code is available [here](https://github.com/AlesTsurko/docio).
